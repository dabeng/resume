## Hobbies & Interest
- Github Repos

The more js skills are shared, the more easy js programmers' lives become.

- Topic Share

It's my pleasure and duty to update the colleagues's understanding of js frameworks, js libraries and js itself.

- Medium

There are so many js masters on [Medium](https://medium.com/), It would be extremely excited to read their technical articles cause doing so make you keep pace with the new development of the  js field.

- Basketball

Let other departments’ colleagues love me  and maybe this game provide me  more chances that js will play a bigger role.

- Fishing

Trust me. The most beautiful surroundings is the best  place to figure out the hardest issues or bugs. So waterside spot is a good choice. Moreover, fisherman and bug-fixer are two of a kind.

- Keep families company

Families is always my source of happiness. I code for my families.
